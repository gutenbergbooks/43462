<h2>Preface</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Far</span> out in the broad island-dotted and
island-fringed Pacific Ocean lies an island
group known as the Hawaiian or Sandwich
Islands.</p>

<p>The brave voyager Captain Cook, who discovered
these Hawaiian Islands, found living
there a brown-skinned people, whose descendants
live there to this day. Indeed, most of
the island dwellers in the Pacific are of the
brown race, which we know as one of the
great divisions of the human family.</p>

<p>As the years passed by, the brown people
living on the Hawaiian Islands came into
closer relations with America. The islands
are on the line of trade and travel between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
America and Asia. Our missionaries went
there, and the people welcomed them gladly.</p>

<p>At length the time came when the Hawaiian
Islands asked the greatest of the American
nations, our United States, to receive them
into her family; for they saw that they could
not govern themselves as wisely alone as with
her help. Thus these brown, childlike people
came to be among the youngest of the
adopted children of our nation.</p>

<p>Our government has accepted a great trust
in undertaking to care for these people who
are of a different race and who live far from
our shores. We shall all of us feel much interest
in seeing that our adopted brothers and
sisters are treated kindly, wisely, and well.
We shall not forget that, far apart as they
are from us in distance and by race descent,
they are yet our kindred. So we shall be
doubly glad to meet and know our little
Hawaiian cousin.</p>

<h2>Our Little Hawaiian Cousin</h2>



<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A HAPPY CHILD.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Little</span> Auwae is beautiful; but, better
than that, much better, she has no thought
of it herself.</p>

<p>She sits in front of her low cottage home
singing a soft sweet song, weaving a garland
of scarlet flowers to adorn her head. As she
carefully places each bud on the string, she
looks up at the American flag floating in
the breezes not far away.</p>

<p>The schoolmaster of the village tells her it
is in honour of George Washington, the greatest
man of the United States; that if he had
not lived, America would not be what she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span> is
to-day, and she might not have been able to
give Hawaii the help needed when trouble
came.</p>

<p>But what cares little Auwae for all this?
What difference does it make to her that her
island home, the land of beauty and of flowers,
is under American rule? To be sure, a few
of the "grown-ups" in the place look sober
for a moment when they speak of the change
since the old days of Hawaii's kings; but the
sadness passes in a moment, and the gentle,
happy child-people turn again to their joys
and sports.</p>

<p>Auwae has shining brown eyes, and, as she
smiles at the homely little dog curled up at
her side, one can see two rows of beautiful
white teeth. Her skin, although of such a
dark brown, is so clear and lustrous one cannot
help admiring it. The girl is not afraid
of tan or freckles. She rarely wears any head
covering save a garland of flowers, if that c<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>ould
be called such; but she bathes herself frequently
with cocoanut oil, which makes the
skin soft and shiny.</p>

<p>She takes an abundance of exercise in the
open air; she swims like the fabled mermaid;
she rides for miles at a time over the rough
mountain passes on the back of her favourite
horse. It is no wonder that this plump little
maiden of ten years is the picture of health
and grace.</p>

<p>Her home is a perfect bower. It stands in
a grove of tall cocoa-palms, whose beauty cannot
be imagined by those who live in the temperate
lands and who see them growing only
in the hothouses. They are tall and stately,
yet graceful as the willow; their long, curved
stems reach up sixty, seventy, sometimes even
one hundred feet toward the sky, then spread
out into a magnificent plume of leaves from
twelve to twenty feet in length. The breeze
makes low, sweet music as it moves gently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
across the tree-tops and keeps company with
Auwae's song.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 346px;">
<img src="images/i021.jpg" width="346" height="500" alt="hut with woman walking by" />
<span class="caption">&quot;IT IS A LOW BUILDING WHOSE SIDES AND HIGH SLOPING
ROOF ARE THATCHED WITH GRASSES&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Beneath the trees the grass is of the most
vivid green, mixed with delicate ferns; the
garden in front of the house is filled with
gorgeous flowering plants,&mdash;roses, lilies, oleanders,
geraniums, tuberoses, scenting the air
with their perfume; besides many others
known only in tropical lands.</p>

<p>The garden wall at the side is hidden by
masses of the night-blooming cereus, which is
such a curiosity in our own country that often
many people gather to watch the opening of a
single flower.</p>

<p>Vines hanging full of the scarlet passion-flower
drape the veranda on which Auwae
sits. When she has finished her wreath, she
crowns her long hair with it, and turns to go
into the house.</p>

<p>She makes a pretty picture, the little girl
with her simple white dress, beneath which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the bare brown feet are seen,&mdash;those feet
which have never yet been pressed out of
shape by stiff, tight casings of leather.</p>

<p>I call it a house, yet many speak of it as
a hut. It is a low building whose sides and
high sloping roof are thatched with grasses.
Few such are made nowadays in Hawaii, for
the people are fast following the example of
the white settlers, and now build their cottages
of wood, and divide them into rooms, so that
they look like the homes commonly found in
New England villages.</p>

<p>Auwae's father, however, clings to the old
fashions of his people, and his little daughter
has always lived in this beautiful grass house.
The frame was made of bamboo poles fastened
together by ropes of palm-leaf fibres. Days
were spent in gathering the grasses for thatching
the sides and roof of the house. They
were woven into beautiful patterns for the
roof. It was necessary to choose skilful w<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>orkmen
who knew just how to finish the corners,
for the heavy rains of the tropics must not be
given a chance to soak through the outside
and make it damp within. When it was finished
the house looked like a large bird's nest
upside down.</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem, there is no floor
in the house, but the ground is paved with
stones. It is nearly covered with large mats.
Some of these are made with rushes, while
others have been woven from leaves of the
pandanus-tree. They are stained in bright
colours and odd patterns. A large screen of
woven pandanus leaves divides the sleeping
portion from the rest of the house.</p>

<p>There is no furniture, unless one can call
by such a name the great number of mats
in the corner. They serve for couches, bedspreads,
and screens. In one corner is a
collection of gourds and bowls, or calabashes,
as they are called. Some of them are polished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
highly and prettily ornamented. If Auwae's
father desired to do so, he could sell these calabashes
to the American "curio" collector for
a goodly sum of money; but he will not part
with a single one. They are of all sizes, from
that of a tiny teacup to the great "company"
calabash, which holds at least ten gallons.</p>

<p>When there are many visitors at Auwae's
home, this calabash is used at meal-time. It
will hold enough food to satisfy the appetites
of a large party.</p>

<p>The greatest treasure stands at one side near
the wall. It looks like a mammoth dust-brush,
but it is a sacred thing in this Hawaiian family.
It is the mark of chieftainship. None other
than a chief had, in the old days, a right to
own such a thing, under the penalty of death.
The long handle of polished bone is topped
by a large plume of peacock feathers. The
ancient kings of Hawaii were always attended
by bearers carrying "Kahilis," as the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
call them, and two enormous plumes stood at
the threshold of their homes. No common
person could pass by this sign of royalty or
chieftainship, and enter a dwelling so marked,

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>AN OUTDOOR KITCHEN.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Auwae</span> does not linger within the house,
but follows a sound of talking and laughter
in the grove behind the house. There she
finds her mother and grandmother, together
with a number of the neighbouring women.
They, too, are weaving garlands, for they wish
to decorate their husbands when they come
home to dinner.</p>

<p>Auwae's mother is making her wreath of
bright orange-coloured seeds taken from the
fruit of the pandanus. She wears a garland
like Auwae's, except that she has used flowers
of another colour. She has wound a beautiful
vine around her waist and throat, which sets
off her loose red dress to perfection. She is a
fat woman, but as beauty is often measured by
size among the Hawaiians, she must be considere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>d
quite handsome.</p>

<p>What is it that makes her look so different
from her white sisters? It is not the brown
skin, bare feet, and flowing hair like her
daughter's. It must be her happiness and
the grace of all her movements. She seems
to be actually without a care as she leans back
in the grass and pats her little daughter's head.
Her laugh is just as joyous as Auwae's. Her
hands do not bear the marks of labour, but
are soft and dimpled as a child's.</p>

<p>She, a grown woman, is idly making wreaths
in company with her neighbours, instead of
cooking and sweeping, dusting and sewing for
the family! Think of it and wonder. But
then, you say, this is a holiday; why should
they not be idle and gay? The fact is, all
days are like this to the Hawaiian mother,
who lives the life of a grown-up child. The
world does not seem so serious as some people
think. It is a happy dream, and mother and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
child and neighbour dance and sing, swim and
ride, in sunshine and in rain alike.</p>

<p>This reminds me that in their language
there is no word for <i>weather</i>. It is continual
summer there unless one climb high up on
the mountainsides; and as for rain, it does
not worry the people, for can they not dry
themselves in the clear air that follows?
There is, therefore, no need of this disagreeable
word which one hears so often in some
parts of America. All days are alike to the
Hawaiians.</p>

<p>Auwae's mother has no servant, for there is
little housework to be done in her home. The
grass hut is scarcely used except for sleeping
purposes. Both cooking and eating are done
out-of-doors. The little girl's father has built
an oven in the ground near the house, with
enough room in it to roast the food for his
own family as well as two or three of his
neighbours.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 346px;">
<img src="images/i031.jpg" width="346" height="500" alt="people sitting on ground under palm trees by a big pot" />
<span class="caption">&quot;THE PARTY SIT ON THE GRASS IN A CIRCLE&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>He dug a pit in the ground and lined it
with stones. Whenever cooking needs to be
done, he fills this pit full of wood, which he
sets on fire. When the stones are sufficiently
heated, the pig, chickens, or beef, and the
taro, or sweet potatoes, are wrapped up in
leaves and placed in the oven; a little water
is thrown over them so they will steam. Then
the hole is covered over tightly, and the food
is slowly and nicely baked.</p>

<p>Auwae's dinner has been cooking all the
morning, and it is nearly time for it to be
served. What do you think shall be done
to prepare for it? Who of the company will
stop her chattering and garland-making long
enough to set the table?</p>

<p>As among the brown people of Borneo,
there is nothing to do except to uncover the
oven, take out the food, and place it on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
grassy table-cloth, while Auwae runs into
the house for some calabashes. There must
be a large one to hold the "poi," and a smaller
one for drinking-water. No plates are needed.</p>

<p>For to-day's dinner there is a roast of beef
to eat with the poi, and delicious cocoanut
milk takes the place of the coffee sometimes
drunk. For dessert there are the most delicious
wild strawberries, which ripen all the
year round in this favoured island of the
Pacific.</p>

<p>If Auwae wished, she could have a banana
or a fresh pineapple, but she is easily satisfied.
Think of it! there are forty different fruits
growing near her house. One can easily
understand how there is little work in providing
food, and how little cooking is needed
to keep the body in good health.</p>

<p>And now Auwae's father and several other
men join the women. The garlands of flowers
are placed around their necks and on their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
heads, and the party sit on the grass in a circle
around the bowl of steaming poi.</p>

<p>But how do they eat? The poi, a sticky
paste, is the principal dish. Surely something
must be used to carry it to the mouth. That
is true, and the fingers serve this very purpose.
One after another, or all together, however it
may happen, the company dip into the great
calabash and skilfully roll balls of the paste
on their forefingers, bringing it to their
mouths without dropping a particle. Poi is
called "one-finger," "two-finger," or "three-finger,"
according to the thickness of the
paste.</p>

<p>But what is poi? is asked. It is the food
best liked by the Hawaiian, and takes the
place of the bread of the white people. It is
either pink or lavender in colour. In the old
days, pink poi was a royal dish, as it was only
made for kings and queens. The different
kinds are all made from the root of the taro
plant. A small patch of this very valuable
plant will supply a large family with all th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>e
food they really need for a whole year.</p>

<p>The principal work of the little girl's father
is to tend his taro patch and keep each little
hillock surrounded by water. From the time
of planting until the ripening of the beet-like
bulbs, he watches it with the most loving care.
When fully ripe, he pulls up the plants and
bakes the bulbs in his underground oven.</p>

<p>When they have been sufficiently dried, he
prepares for his most difficult task by stripping
himself of his cotton shirt and trousers. You
remember that the climate here is a warm one,
and when the man is working hard he suffers
much from the heat.</p>

<p>He now takes the baked taro and puts it on
a wooden platter and beats it with a heavy
stone pestle. From time to time he dips his
hands into water as they grow sticky from
handling the pasty mass. After he has
pounded it for a long time, he puts it into
calabashes, adds water, and sets it a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>way for
several days to ferment.</p>

<p>He grows very tired before his work is over,
but does it gladly, rather than do without his
favourite food. It would not suit us, I fear,
as it tastes very much like sour buckwheat
paste. In Hawaii white people often eat the
taro root sliced and boiled or baked, but they
seldom touch it when prepared in the native
fashion.</p>

<p>Now let us return to Auwae's dinner-table.
The food is quickly eaten, after which the little
girl passes a calabash of water around among
the company. It is to serve as a finger-bowl.
Does this surprise you? Ah! but you must
remember these Hawaiians ate with their fingers.
These same fingers are now sticky with
poi, and as the people are natural lovers of
water, they are fond of having every part
of their bodies spotless.</p>

<p>A pipe and tobacco are pa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>ssed around for
a smoke. These people, so cleanly in some
other ways, do not object to using the one pipe
in common. The women put away the food,
and the company prepare for a picnic at the
shore but a short distance from the house.
They will spend the afternoon in surf-bathing,
and all of them will perform feats in the water
that would astonish the best swimmers in
other countries.</p>



<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SURF-RIDING.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Auwae</span> has a loved playmate, Upa, a boy
a little older than herself. He goes with the
party to the beach. Carrying their surf-boards
under their arms, the two children hurry ahead
to the beach of shining white coral sand.
Look! The broad Pacific now stretches out
before their eyes. How blue are the waters,
reaching out in the distance till they seem to
meet a sky just as blue and clear of a passing
cloud! How the hot sunshine beats down
upon the sand! Yet Auwae does not seem
to mind it. She stoops to pick a wild morning-glory
growing almost at the water's edge,
and then dances about, saying to Upa:</p>

<p>"Hurrah! The waves are just fine to-day
for bathing, aren't they?"</p>

<p>We almost hold our breath at the thought
of these children trusting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span> themselves out in
the high waves rushing in from the coral reef
a quarter of a mile outside. Then, too, we
know there are sharks in these waters; and
what a terrible death would be Auwae's if one
of these creatures should grind her between his
many teeth!</p>

<p>As to the sharks, we need not fear, as they
never venture nearer than the coral reefs,
which seem to be a wall beyond which they
dare not pass. And as for the water! why,
when we have once seen Auwae swim, we can
no longer fear for her safety. It seems as
though water, instead of land, must be her
natural abiding-place.</p>

<p>But now the rest of the party have arrived,
bringing with them their surf-boards, or wave-sliding-boards,
as we might call them.</p>

<p>For those living on Hawaii's shore, much
of the pleasure of life depends on these pieces
of wood so carefully prepared. They are made
from the strong, tough trunk of the breadfruit-tree,
are highly polished, and about two feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
wide. They look very much like coffin lids,
and are long enough for one to stretch at length
upon them.</p>

<p>It takes but a few moments to remove their
clothing and put on their bathing-costumes.
For the men, it is the malo, a piece of cloth
wound about the loins and between the legs,
and, before the white people came, the only
garment worn by them at any time.</p>

<p>All are now ready for the sport. They
wade out into deep water with the surf-boards
under their arms. Then, pushing them in
front, they swim out till they reach the breakers,
when they suddenly dive and disappear
from view.</p>

<p>There is no sign of them for several
moments. Now look far out and you can
see their black heads bobbing about in the
smooth water beyond the waves. Watch
them carefully as they wait for that great
roller about to turn toward the shore. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>y
leap upon its crest, lying flat upon their
boards, and are borne to the beach with the
speed of the wind.</p>

<p>It must be grand sport, once they know
just how and when to take advantage of the
incoming wave, as well as the still greater skill
in riding on that wave without being swallowed
by it. It is harder to succeed than one imagines
before trying the experiment himself, for
the swimmers are obliged to use their hands
and feet constantly to keep themselves in
place.</p>

<p>Some of them do not even rest on the shore
before swimming out for another wave slide;
and as the afternoon passes they rival each
other in more and more daring feats. See
those two men no longer lying flat on their
boards as they rush onward in the water!
They only kneel, and wave their arms and
shout in glee to their companions. But most
daring of all is Auwae's father, who act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>ually
stands erect as he is borne toward the shore on
the crest of a huge wave. He travels at a rate
sufficient to deprive one of breath.</p>

<p>The kind man takes time during the afternoon
to give Auwae lessons in riding her own
board, which he has lately made for her. Up
to this time she has had to be content with
swimming only, and in this, as I told you, she
is already wonderfully skilful and graceful.</p>

<p>The hours pass only too quickly, and night
suddenly shuts down upon the happy people.
The moon comes out in such beauty as is seen
only in the tropics. It bathes sea and shore in
a soft, sweet light, so pleasant after the dazzling
brightness of the sun. Auwae and Upa
once more lead the party as they wander
slowly homeward and again enter the shadow
of the tall palm-trees.</p>

<p>The children look toward the mountains
behind the village reac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>hing up so grandly till
their tops are lost in the clouds, and Upa
says:</p>

<p>"Auwae, do you know that my father is
going to Kilauea next week, and he says
I may go with him. Ask your father if you
may go, too. It will be such fun!"</p>

<p>Auwae has wished a long, long time for
such a chance as this. She claps her hands
in delight, as she feels quite sure of her parents'
consent.</p>

<p>Kilauea! She has heard so much about the
mighty crater. Even now she can see a faint
reddish gleam light up the sky in the distance.
The largest active volcano in the world is
showing that it is still alive and using the
mighty forces directed from the very bowels
of the earth.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p><p>It would almost seem as if Auwae would
feel fear at living in the shadow of a volcano.
Is she not sometimes awakened in the night
by the low rumbling sound coming to her
through the clear air? And does she not
then lie trembling at the thought that she
may sometime be swallowed up in a tremendous
flow of lava? Other children in towns
like hers have met such a fate in the years that
are gone. Why should she not fear?</p>

<p>But Auwae was born here, and has always
lived where she could see the light from that
huge furnace of Nature. She is so used to it
that she does not dread its power. She lives
in the joy of the present, and does not consider
that which might possibly come to her.</p>

<p>Think of it! This home of hers and its
sister islands are the children of volcanoes, for
they were born of fierce explosions of lava,
thrown above the surrounding waters from
the floor of the sea. Foot by foot Hawaii
has been built up out of the water. Layer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
after layer of lava has been poured, one above
the other; then, cooling and crumbling, a soil
has been formed on which the beautiful plants
and trees of the tropics have taken root.</p>

<p>But this is not the whole story of the island,
for tiny creatures of the sea have given what
was in their power. The coral reefs lying
along the shore have been built up by the
growth of millions of polyps, and the shining
white sand is composed of finely ground coral,
which once formed the skeletons of similar
polyps.</p>

<p>What curious helpers Mother Nature sometimes
chooses! Think of the coral polyps and
their strange lives, leaving when they die a
foundation upon which men and animals shall
afterward have a home! Upa often dives for
the sprays of coral, pink or white. He sells
them to the white people in the village, who
send them as curiosities to other countries.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>
<p>Auwae and Upa bid each other good night
at the garden wall. The little girl stops for
a moment at the pond in the garden where
many goldfish are moving about in the moonlight.
She loves her beautiful fish; she feeds
them every day, and often thinks how kind
her father was to make the pond for her
delight.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>QUARTERLY REVIEW.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> she stands beside the beautiful clear
water, an unpleasant thought comes into her
mind. It was only yesterday that some white
travellers came through the village on horseback.
A little girl about Auwae's own age
was in the party. She was very pretty. Her
cheeks were pink and white; her hair was like
the golden sunlight; her eyes were as clear
and blue as the waters surrounding the beautiful
island.</p>

<p>"Why wasn't I made white?" the little
brown girl said to herself. "If I should bathe
myself over and over again, it would make no"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
difference. I should never look like her. Oh,
dear, I will ask mother why God made us so
different.</p>

<p>She ran quickly back down the pathway till
she met her mother.</p>

<p>"Mamma," she whispered, "I think you
are just lovely as you are, but still I do wish
I had been born to look like the little American
girl I saw yesterday on horseback."</p>

<p>"My dear one," answered her mother,
"God is love, and all are alike to Him. In
the fields around us He has made flowers
of many kinds and colours. Some roses are
red, and some are white, yet the red and the
white are equally admired. So it is with
the people who share His life. Some are
of one colour, some another; they are all
needed to give variety and beauty to the
world. All are equally His work. Be happy
and contented, my darling, and think no more
about it."</p>

<p>Auwae's eyes grow bright again as her
mother speaks. The shadow passes away,
and she is her own joyous self again.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course it is all right. I'm glad I'm
just what I am," she exclaims. "And yet,
mamma, when Christmas comes, I believe I
should like a white doll that would look like
that little girl. I could have such fun playing
with her and curling her hair. You know we
often put red and white roses in the same bowl,
and they look very pretty together."</p>

<p>"All right, I will remember your wish
when the time comes," laughs her good-natured
mother, while Auwae hastens away,
half dancing, half running.</p>

<p>She must certainly hurry to bed now, for
to-morrow is a school day, and she wishes to
wake early in the morning. The moon shines
so brightly to-night that Auwae can easily see
to undress by it and stretch upon the floor the
strip of tapa which serves for her bed. If it
were dark, however, she would use an odd
candle that she herself made. It is formed
of candlenuts strung together. They grew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
near Auwae's home, and are so much like
wax they burn readily. I should much prefer
them to a calabash of beef fat with a rag for
a wick, which is sometimes used by Auwae's
mother.</p>

<p>"Now I lay me down to sleep," repeats the
gentle child, as she kneels in her little corner,
and is soon fast asleep.</p>

<p>Where did Auwae learn this prayer? It
was in the white church in the village. There
the old Hawaiian minister tells his little flock
every Sunday of the One True God, and of
the loving Friend who said: "Suffer little
children to come unto me, and forbid them
not, for of such is the kingdom of heaven."</p>

<p>Auwae loves her Sunday school; she delights
in the music of the organ and the songs
she learns there. Every three months there is
a grand celebration in the church. It is called
"Quarterly Review." All the children in the
country for miles around come flocking into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Auwae's village. It is such a pretty sight, as
the boys and girls come marching over the
hillsides! The girls are dressed in white,
and everybody wears a wreath and festoons
of bright flowers. Sometimes they sing as
they march along.</p>

<p>By ten o'clock in the morning the church
is closely packed and the music begins. There
is song after song, after which the children are
called one by one to the platform to speak
pieces and recite Bible verses. The ones who
have learned most receive the prizes. Auwae
won a prize at the last quarterly review. It is
a picture of the infant Jesus giving water to
his cousin John from a shell. No doubt you
have seen a copy of it. Auwae thinks it is a
lovely picture. It is the only one of any kind
in her house.</p>

<p>The quarterly review lasts the whole day.
The children do not get tired, however.
They have a picnic dinner under the trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
behind the church; then they are ready for
more songs, and speak more pieces, until the
round red sun in the west says:</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 338px;">
<img src="images/i051.jpg" width="338" height="500" alt="Tiki inside door with two children peeping in" />
<span class="caption">&quot;AUWAE AND UPA DARED TO PEEP INSIDE&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Come, my little ones, hurry homeward
quickly. Many of you have miles of walking
before you, and I cannot show you the way
much longer."</p>

<p>Then Auwae bids her friends good-bye.
She will not again see some of them till three
months more have passed.</p>

<p>Aloha! Aloha! echoes back from the hill-tops,
and our little girl turns again to her own
lovely nest under the palm-trees. How different
everything is now from the old days of
Auwae's people! Her grandmother has told
her about the hideous idols they used to
worship.</p>

<p>There is an old heathen temple but a few
miles from her home, and once, just once,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Auwae and Upa dared to peep inside; then
they ran away with all their might, for fear
that somehow those long rows of ugly figures
might become alive and follow them.</p>

<p>Think of it! less than a hundred years ago
not only animals, but human beings, little
children even, were sacrificed to hideous
wooden and stone idols.</p>

<p>The people were in constant terror of the
god of the shark, the goddess of the volcano,
and other fearful beings who were ever ready,
as they thought, to bring destruction upon
them. Besides these, there were great giants
and monsters whose anger must be satisfied
by offerings of animals and men.</p>

<p>"How glad I am that I live now instead
of a hundred years ago," says Auwae to Upa
many times, as she thinks of Pele, the goddess
of the volcano Kilauea. "Grandma has told
me of her own mother, who really believed
that Pele lived far down in the fiery crater,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
that she was the ruler and queen of fire.
She thought that other spirits, too, lived
there. There was the spirit of steam, the
spirit of the thunderbolt, the spirit of strength,
and I don't know how many other terrible
beings. And oh, what times those spirits had
together in the flames, dancing and making
merry! But if the people forgot to bring
Pele their offerings of hogs and bananas and
all sorts of presents, she would get fearfully
angry, and roar and threaten to overflow the
country with lava. They would get very
much frightened, and hasten to the summit
of the volcano with the best they had."</p>

<p>And then perhaps Upa answers, "Please
don't speak of those awful days any more.
I like best to think of the time when our
people turned from such ideas of their own
accord, saying they were just nonsense. But,
really, it must have taken a brave woman to
do what Queen Kapiolani did. You know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
she walked right up the side of the mountain
with her trembling followers, and kept on till
she reached the very mouth of the crater, and
then dared Pele to do her worst. She turned
to her followers, and said: 'I do not believe
in Pele! If there is no such being, no harm
will come.' Of course, the people expected
the fiery waves to leap up and swallow them,
but nothing did happen, you know.</p>

<p>"Hurrah for the old queen's pluck, I say.
After that, women dared to eat bananas and
do many other things the priests had forbidden
to all but men, saying it would make the gods
angry. How silly the people used to be in
those days!"</p>

<p>Then both children are still for a moment
as they think lovingly of the good missionaries
who came to their land just as their own people
had given up idols. The good men and
women came to tell them something better
than they had ever known,&mdash;something to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
drive fear from their hearts, to destroy the
cruel power of the priests, and to bring freedom
of mind and body. What was it? The
love of God!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>AUWAE'S SCHOOL.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the morning after the picnic the little
brown maiden is awake bright and early.
After her breakfast of poi and yams she
weaves a wreath of fresh flowers for her head,
and, taking her books under her arm, begins
her walk to the village school. Her way leads
past Upa's home, and the boy is already waiting
for her. As she comes near he shouts:</p>

<p>"Oh, Auwae, I have something to show
you. You've got time to stop a few minutes
without being late to school. Come with
me."</p>

<p>And the boy leads the way down a path
to a tree covered with vines trailing from the
topmost branches to the ground. It makes
a perfect bower of the sweet-smelling blossoms;
but it is not this Upa wishes to show.
He leads Auwae close to the trunk of the
tree and bids her look straight upward to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
an odd nest gnawed in the trunk far above
them. From the hole two bright eyes are
peering down at the children. They belong
to a large rat that has made his home in the
tree; perhaps he did this to be sure of safety
from small boys. Or possibly it was to secure
himself from the raids of the mongoose, so
common in Hawaii nowadays.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 337px;">
<img src="images/i059.jpg" width="337" height="500" alt="woman washing in stream" />
<span class="caption">&quot;A LITTLE STREAM WHERE TWO WOMEN ARE WASHING&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Poor little fellow," says Auwae, "I don't
blame him. Father says that a good many
rats live in the trees near here, but I never
saw them there before. And father says, too,
that the white men brought the mongoose here
from India to drive out the rats, but the little
fellows are not satisfied with killing them off;
they want our chickens, too. It's a perfect
shame. I wish they had stayed in their own
country." <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>As the children now hurry on their way,
they areobliged to cross a little stream where
two women are washing. There are neither
tubs, scrubbing-boards, nor soap to be seen.
The clothing is dipped into the soft water and
the parts most soiled are rubbed on flat stones.
It must be rather hard on garments made of
fine cloth, and it seems as though the women
would get tired bending down. After all,
there are but few things to wash, and, as the
people do not work hard, their clothing cannot
get badly soiled.</p>

<p>But look! Here come some of Auwae's
schoolmates to join them. They are swimming
down the stream. Each carries her
clothing in a small bundle in her hand; she
holds it out of the water as she paddles along.
It is such a common matter that Auwae is not
in the least surprised.</p>

<p>The schoolhouse is soon reached. It has
but one large room, as there are but thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
children in the village. Much of the time the
gentle schoolmaster sits with his pupils under
the large tree near by. Auwae likes that
much the best. She can never get used to
the close air inside the house. But to-day the
children must do some writing, so they sit at
their desks and compose letters to their adopted
brothers and sisters in America.</p>

<p>How odd it seems to see the schoolmaster
tend his baby while he teaches the children!
Why didn't he leave it with his wife at home?
Because in this island of flowers it is the duty
of men as well as women to act as nurses. It
seems a strange idea to us, but, if they are
satisfied, it must be all right.</p>

<p>Look at the baby! He is wrapped in
enough clothing for six such tiny beings,
and drops of perspiration are running down
his face; but he does not cry.</p>

<p>"Aloha!" says our little Auwae, as she
bows before her teacher. And "Aloha!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
he replies, in a kind sweet voice. How many
things this one word means! It answers
for "good morning," "good-bye," "love,"
"thanks," and I don't know what else. But
the smile that goes with it seems always to
explain its meaning and make it the most
delightful of words.</p>

<p>In Auwae's land the language was never
written until the white people came to teach
and help the Hawaiians. But it is very easy
to understand, and Auwae could read when
she had been at school only a few weeks.
She had only twelve letters to learn. Every
word and syllable of the Hawaiian language
ends in vowels, and there are no hard sounds
to pronounce. The sentences flow like music;
so it is no wonder that Auwae composes
poems so easily. They are very pretty, however,
and her teacher is proud of her.</p>

<p>Auwae can tell you a great deal of the
history of her island home. There are some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
parts of it that she loves to hear over and
over again. On many a warm night as she
lies on the grass with her head in her father's
lap, she will look up into his kind eyes, and
say:</p>

<p>"Papa, do tell me again about the very
first Hawaiians. How did people come to
live here after the island had grown up out
of the sea? I can seem to see the seeds
and twigs floating on to the shores with the
tide. I can see the seeds sprouting and shooting
up into tall trees out of the lava soil.
But I wish you would describe again the
boats loaded with people coming here from
far away."</p>

<p>Then Auwae's father tells her of the time
when there were no grass houses, nor brown
children playing about them. He relates the
stories handed down for hundreds of years
about people living on distant islands across
the equator. They were not treated kindly in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
their own land, and wished to find a new
home where they could be happy and free.
They were much like the Pilgrims who left
Europe, and were willing to bear hardship
and danger in New England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>LONG AGO.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> old Hawaiians, who in those far-away
times called themselves Savaiians, loaded their
boats with provisions and other needed supplies.
They set sail with their wives and
children in hope of soon finding a pleasant
home in some new island. Their voyage was
longer, however, than they expected. Storms
arose, and many of the poor little children
grew sick and died. But the boats, which
were hardly more than large canoes lashed
together, rode safely onward. After many
days the people saw the shores of the
Hawaiian Islands ahead of them.</p>

<p>How glad they were to stand on dry land
once more! They found a sheltered valley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
where they soon made themselves comfortable.
They had brought with them some chickens,
two or three pigs and dogs, besides the seeds
of the breadfruit, and the kou trees. They
found the taro plant already growing there.
They had made poi from it in their old home,
so they knew how to use it. Besides this,
they found the kapa-tree. From its bark
they could make new garments to take the
place of their sea-worn clothing.</p>

<p>They were very happy. Children were born
in this new and beautiful land. Seeds were
planted; more pigs and chickens were raised.
It was the Golden Age of Hawaii, for there
were peace and plenty.</p>

<p>Even the Brownies helped the settlers, and
often worked wonders in the land. At least,
this is what Auwae's father said, and I think
he believed in these queer little beings.</p>

<p>When he mentioned the Brownies,&mdash;Menehunes
he called them,&mdash;Auwae's eyes grew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
large with delight. She loved to hear about
this race of dwarfs who were said to have built
immense fish-ponds and sea-wells. Why, if
you yourself, should doubt there were such
beings, Auwae could point to their large stone
ruins not far from her home. She would say:</p>

<p>"Do you suppose any living people could
set such great stones in place? Surely not!
The Brownies are the only ones having
strength enough to do work like that. Why,
they are able to pass big stones from one to
another for miles."</p>

<p>Her father tells her that the secret of the
Brownies' power is that they <i>work together</i>
and work till their work is done. When
human people sleep they are busy, but if
mortals walk abroad at such times the
Brownies make themselves invisible. Those
were certainly wonderful times when the
spirits of the earth worked for men, and did
such mighty deeds in Hawaii.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>But an end soon came to this joy and
comfort, for men began to quarrel and have
wars against each other. Then the Brownies
withdrew their aid, and left them to themselves.
Sickness fell upon the Hawaiians.
There were many rulers, each one trying to
gain all the power possible. The rich grew
richer, and the poor poorer. Wicked priests,
as well as the chiefs and masters, held the
people in fear. It was a sad, sad time. The
"chiefesses" (for there were women rulers)
were no better than the men.</p>

<p>At last a child was born in Hawaii, who was
unusually strong and wise. He grew up and
became a great chief. His name was Kamehameha.
That word means "The Lonely
One." He was very ambitious. He looked
over the island of Hawaii, and said to himself:</p>

<p>"I will make myself king of this whole
land. I will bring the people more closely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
together. I will change many of the customs
which are bad and harmful."</p>

<p>He kept his word. He rallied his own men
around him, and was soon ruler of the entire
island. But still he was not satisfied. He
looked across the sea to other islands, and
said:</p>

<p>"I will be ruler over all these, too. My
kingdom shall be a powerful one."</p>

<p>He sailed with his troops in his strong
war-canoes, and soon landed on the island
of Maui, not far from Hawaii.</p>

<p>The king of that island had been warned
of the coming of the enemy. He was already
marching down a narrow pass between
the mountains to meet The Lonely One and
his army.</p>

<p>Kamehameha did not waste a moment. He
rushed up the pass, his men following him
in single file, and there, in a narrow pathway
at least a thousand feet above a deep abyss,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the two armies met. As each one of the
Hawaiian soldiers stepped upward, he met
and grappled with one of the enemy. One
or the other was sure to be hurled downward
over the precipice, and meet death below, if
he were not already killed on the narrow
pathway.</p>

<p>It was a terrible battle. When night came
the army of Maui was no more, and Kamehameha
was ruler of that island.</p>

<p>He was suddenly called back to his own
home, for news came that a rebel leader in
Hawaii had risen against him. This leader
encamped with his men near the volcano
Kilauea. As the great Kamehameha advanced
to meet them an earthquake shook the land;
a violent storm of cinders and sand rose out
of the crater to a great height, and then fell
down over the mountainside.</p>

<p>When the men were able to advance once
more it was found that a large part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
rebel army had been killed by the eruption.
At this the people exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Surely the Goddess Pele was angry at the
rebel chief. She chose this way to show her
favour toward Kamehameha."</p>

<p>After this there were other troubles, but The
Lonely One grew more and more powerful.
At last he became the ruler of all the islands.
He did with them as he had promised himself,
and the people were united and happy as
long as he lived.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE COMING OF THE WHITE MEN.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> nearly the same time that this brown
king was born in Hawaii, a baby was born
in far-distant England, who was, many years
after, the first white person to visit Auwae's
home. This baby's name was James Cook.
He was a little country boy. His father was
very poor. James might not even have had a
chance to learn his letters if it had not been
for the kindness of a good woman who lived
in his village.</p>

<p>The boy had to work hard, even when
very small. He did not like his work, either,
and after awhile he said:</p>

<p>"Oh, how I long to leave this place and
be free! I would rather live on the beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
blue ocean than here in the country. I
shouldn't mind doing the hardest things on
board a ship."</p>

<p>After awhile he made up his mind that he
could not bear it any longer. One dark night
he packed up a small bundle of clothing and
ran away to sea.</p>

<p>Do you imagine he found a kind captain
waiting at some dock who became his good
friend and helper? Don't imagine it for a
moment. He did find a captain, and a ship,
too. He also got a chance to work as a cabin-boy,
but he was badly treated, and had to
work far harder than he ever did on land.</p>

<p>Yet he loved the life of the ocean so much
that he kept on sailing, and worked his way
up to a high position. He even became a
captain. People now called him "Captain
Cook," and he was sent on long and dangerous
voyages in the English navy. When he
was at home in England he was invited to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
great dinners, and given high honours, for
he had become a famous man.</p>

<p>At last he was asked to make a more dangerous
voyage than he had ever yet tried.
Wise men thought there might be a short
way for ships to sail from Europe to Asia by
going north of America. There were many
icebergs, to be sure, as well as seas all frozen
over, but perhaps there was a warm current
running through the ocean. Captain Cook
was so wise and brave he was the very man
to try to find the Northwest Passage, as it
was called.</p>

<p>He started out with a goodly fleet. He
sailed for many weeks. Many strange things
happened. You must read the whole story
of the voyage some time. But the brave
captain did not find the Northwest Passage;
he did, however, discover the islands of
Auwae's people.</p>

<p>One morning at sunrise, as he came sailing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
into one of the harbours, the brown natives
flocked to the shore. They had never seen
a ship before. They wondered what it could
be. Was it a forest that had slid down into
the sea? Or was it the temple of Lono with
ladders reaching up to the altars?</p>

<p>It seems that Lono was one of the gods in
whom the brown people still believed. He
had gone away from their island long before,
and had promised to come back some day on
an island bearing cocoanut-trees, swine, and
dogs.</p>

<p>They thought the tall masts must be the
cocoanut-trees, and when they saw the dogs
and swine on board the ships, they were quite
sure the promise had come true. Captain
Cook himself must be Lono come again,
and the sailors were lower gods who served
him.</p>

<p>One of the priests brought a red cloak and
placed it on Captain Cook's shoulders. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
was the mark of his greatness. Such an
honour could only be offered a god.</p>

<p>There were great feasts for the visitors.
Offerings of fruit, chickens, and all good
things possible were made to the white men.
They grew fat on the fine living. They were
merry over their good times. No doubt they
laughed at the foolish belief of the savages, as
they called them. But they did not say:</p>

<p>"My brown friends, we are glad you are
so kind to us, but please don't think we are
great beings. We are human beings like
yourselves."</p>

<p>Do you not think that would have been
wiser and more honest?</p>

<p>After awhile one of the sailors died. Then
the brown people began to think. They said
among themselves:</p>

<p>"Gods cannot die. These people die, so
they cannot be gods."</p>

<p>They began to watch more closely. Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Cook was very quick-tempered. He and his
men sometimes quarrelled with the natives and
were cruel. At last, sad to say, the brave
captain was killed in one of these quarrels.</p>

<p>Some people believe the Hawaiians of that
time were cannibals and ate his dead body.
But this is not true. Auwae would feel very
badly if she thought her American brothers
and sisters could believe this. Captain Cook
was a very great and brave man in the opinion
of the brown child, as well as in yours. But
he ought not to have let the people believe he
was anything else than himself,&mdash;a white traveller
from other lands.</p>

<p>There is a monument to his memory on the
island, and when you visit Auwae she will take
you to see it.</p>

<p>After Captain Cook's death other white
men came and taught the Hawaiians many
things. They helped the rulers in governing
wisely; and at last the people saw it was best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
to put themselves under the care of their white
brothers.</p>

<p>Auwae likes to read about the old days,
however. She delights in hearing her grandmother
tell of her own youth; of the visit the
king once made to her village; and of the
grand celebration in his honour. The days
were given up to feasting and entertainments.
Men practised boxing and wrestling for a long
time beforehand; there were wonderful feats
on horseback, in which Auwae's grandfather
took part.</p>

<p>As he rode at full gallop through the village,
he surpassed all others in leaning from his
horse and picking small coins from the ground.
Best of all, the old woman said, as he rode
along he wrung off the necks of fowls whose
bodies were buried in the ground. And this he
did without checking his horse's pace at all.</p>

<p>But the most joyful part of the day was
when the king, fairly covered with wreaths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
of flowers, took his place under a beautiful
pandanus-tree; then his subjects, one by one,
came up before him, and, cheering and bowing,
gave him offerings. It was always the
best which the people offered their lord.
There were presents of live fowls, hogs, clusters
of bananas, cakes of seaweed, eggs, cocoanuts,
nets of sweet potatoes, taro; everything
which the king could desire.</p>

<p>"What joy and good-will those days
brought!" says Auwae's grandmother. "It
was the happiest time of my life."</p>

<p>The old woman takes a great deal of interest
in everything her little granddaughter does.
She is very proud of Auwae's collection of
land-shells. She thinks it must be the finest
one any child possesses in the whole island.
She, herself, gave Auwae at least half of the
different varieties. She had kept them from
the time of her own childhood.</p>

<p>Did you ever hear of land-shells? They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
are found on the low, overhanging branches
of trees, and the little creatures who make
their homes in them would die if you were to
put them into the salt water. They are very
tiny, and are of many different tints. Auwae
has beautiful blue ones, as well as rosy pink,
pale yellow, green, violet, and I don't know
how many other colours. In little basket
trays, side by side, they look very pretty.
Each variety has a tray of its own.</p>

<p>Many days must have been spent in gathering
the collection; many different people have
helped Auwae in making it,&mdash;for often only
a single kind of shell can be found in one
whole island. People in Hawaii exchange
specimens, just as the American boys and
girls trade postage-stamps with each other.
The white people in the village would like to
buy Auwae's collection to send to a museum
across the ocean, but she would not think of
parting with it.</p>



<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE DIVER.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> school is over, Upa and Auwae go
home through the woods so that they can
throw stones in a certain waterfall. They
have no fear that snakes will suddenly take
them by surprise, for there is not a single
one in the whole island. Neither do they
hear frogs croaking beside a shady pool, for
neither frogs nor toads have ever hopped upon
Hawaiian soil.</p>

<p>Wherever they come to an open space
beneath the trees, they play ball. Upa made
his own ball out of leaves which he packed
closely together, and Auwae bound it with
sweet-smelling grasses when he had pressed
it into shape.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy's busy mind has planned new
sport for the afternoon, and he says:</p>

<p>"Auwae, after you have had your nap,
do you want to fish? Old Hiko is going
out to the coral reefs, and he has promised
I should go with him. He says I may bring
you, too, if you wish."</p>

<p>Auwae claps her hands with pleasure, for
it will be a great treat. Hiko is the only
one in the village now who dives for fish.
The other men use lines made from the
fibres of the flax-plant, and are satisfied to
sit in their boats, and lazily wait for bites.
Auwae has grown to be a fine diver, and
hopes to learn something by watching the
old man.</p>

<p>After a dinner of dried devil-fish and sweet
potatoes, with baked seaweed for a relish, and
a delicious pudding of grated taro and cocoanut
milk, our little brown cousin stretches
herself under the trees, and is soon fast asleep.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>She is dreaming of catching fresh-water
shrimps in the stream near her house when
she is roused by a gentle pat on her forehead.
It is Upa, who says:</p>

<p>"We must hurry, Auwae. Hiko is going
in half an hour, and he will not wait for us."</p>

<p>Auwae is instantly wide awake, and after a
loving "Aloha!" to her mother, she hurries
to the shore with Upa.</p>

<p>The old fisherman is already there in his
long, clumsy-looking canoe. He hollowed it
from the trunk of a tree, and there is just
room enough inside for himself and the two
children. At one side of the boat there is an
outrigger to balance it, and make it quite safe.</p>

<p>Hiko has a queer-looking paddle in his
hand, and another beside him. These paddles
are like clumsy wooden spoons; it seems
wonderful how fast they can make the boat
travel over the water.</p>

<p>The children wade out from the shore to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the deeper water where the boat is riding;
then with a bound they spring into their
places, Auwae to steer, and Upa to seize
the other paddle.</p>

<p>On they go till they are directly over the
coral reef. The sea is a beautiful green, and
as clear as glass. Now they let the boat
float along, and all eyes are bent down upon
the groves of coral below the water. All at
once Hiko rises suddenly to his feet, and
springs upon the edge of the canoe; but
first he seizes in one hand a small fish-net,
and in the other a palm leaf.</p>

<p>Ah! down he dives, straight over the side
of the boat! Down! down! Will he ever
come back? Do not fear. This is mere
sport for him,&mdash;surprising a shoal of fish
at play among the coral spires. To the waiting
children it seems as though he were gone
a long time, but in reality it is no more than
a minute.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>As he appears again out of the water they
shout in excitement, "What luck, Hiko?
What luck?" But they do not need to
ask, for they see that his net is half-full.
He has actually brushed the fish into it with
his palm leaf, as your mother brushes crumbs
from the table into the tray.</p>

<p>How beautiful are these fish! They are of
many colours: red, green, blue, and yellow.
Among them is one of a delicate pink tint,
shaped much like a trout. Still another is a
queer-looking fish with a purple body, a blue
spotted tail, and a dark head that shines
brightly in the sunlight.</p>

<p>But the greatest treasure in the old man's
collection is the sea-cock, or ki-hi ki-hi, as he
calls it. Its back is covered with stripes of
black and yellow; it is perfectly round in
shape, while a long, transparent ribbon is fastened
to its nose.</p>

<p>Hiko lifts the sea-cock from the net with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
great pride. To show the children how beautiful
it is while floating in the water, he fastens
a cord through the creature's head, and
drops it below the surface. It looks now like
a gorgeous butterfly as it trails after the boat.</p>

<p>But Hiko is not satisfied yet. He says he
will dive once more, as he wishes to give Upa's
mother a goodly mess of fish for her supper.
At the next dive he is gone for a longer time
than before. Auwae grows fearful just as his
old face appears once more. He is puffing
hard for breath, and his eyes are red and
blood-shot. He has been even more successful
this time, but is quite tired. He
tells the children they can allow the boat to
float for awhile. They may rest for a
luncheon on some of the dainties he has just
secured. Each may choose the fish liked
best.</p>

<p>It seems queer to see the pleasure with
which Auwae's pearly teeth meet in the tail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
of the sea-cock. But such is the habit of
her people, and raw fish seems no stranger
food to her than fresh-picked strawberries or
pineapples.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;IT IS LIKE A LONG, GRAND TOBOGGAN SLIDE&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>The party now paddle their way homewards.
But, listen! A sound of music comes from
the direction of the shore. See! there are at
least four canoes filled with people. They are
coming out for a race, and, as they move
along, are merrily singing in rhythm with the
motion of their paddles.</p>

<p>As they come nearer, our little brown
maiden sees her father and mother amongst
the party. She stands up in the canoe, and
shouts: "Oh, mamma! we have had such
fun! Hiko says we may stay out and race
with you, too."</p>

<p>And now Hiko turns the canoe in the
direction all the others are going. The surf
is running high; there is a good breeze blowing
toward shore, so there will be fine sport.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
All who hold paddles work with a will, and
the canoes are soon beyond the breakers;
then they line up and watch for a big roller.</p>

<p>They have only a minute to wait; all eyes
turn as Hiko shouts, "Hoi! hoi!" ("paddle
with all your might").</p>

<p>The canoes rush onward with all the force
the rowers can put into them; for the boats
must be moving fast enough when the breaker
reaches them to keep up with the onrushing
water. Otherwise they will be overturned,
and the people obliged to swim ashore; which
would certainly not be pleasant.</p>

<p>Hurrah! The canoes are suddenly lifted
up to a great height by the mighty power
of the roller; then down they suddenly drop
to level water again and speed onward to the
shore. It is like a long, grand toboggan slide,
only it is on water instead of snow or ice.</p>

<p>Auwae's boat reaches the beach first of all.
There is a shout of laughter from the gay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
company who follow. It is because one of
the canoes has been left far behind the others.
Of course the best fun lies in winning this
queer water race.</p>

<p>The sport continues for an hour or more,
till it seems as though every one must be
tired out. Then they draw the canoes up on
the shore and lie about on the sand for story
telling.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>STORIES OF OLDEN TIME.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Auwae's</span> father repeats a legend handed
down through generations of his family.
"More than four hundred years ago," he
says, "not far from this very spot, there
lived a great chief. His home was not Hawaii,
but he came from a distant land to fight
and win honour under the king of this island.
He became powerful, and was much loved by
the people. His relatives followed, and settled
here with him, and all went merry.</p>

<p>"The time for the monthly festival drew
near; games, races, and trials of strength were
planned to make a pleasant holiday for all.
The chief himself was to take part. He and
his dearest friend were both well trained in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
sliding down the steep hillsides on their polished
sledges; so they agreed to vie with each
other at the festival to see who could win.</p>

<p>"How seldom, friends, these sledges are
used now! What a grand sport it was! I
have a sledge at home used by my father, not
more than six inches wide, and at least eight
feet long. The runners are finely curved and
polished. You must all have seen it.</p>

<p>"But to come back to my story. The
chief knew well just how to throw himself
upon the sledge; he knew the difficult art
of keeping his sledge under him as he slid
down the steep race track; he was able to
guide his sledge with the greatest skill.</p>

<p>"But his friend was as skilful as himself,
so the people expected a close contest. Many
wagers of bunches of bananas and fat pigs
were made.</p>

<p>"The time came, and the two men went
up the hillside with their sledges under their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
arms. They laughed and chatted, and had
just reached the top when a beautiful young
woman suddenly appeared before them.</p>

<p>"She bowed before the chief, and said,
'Will you try the race with me instead of
your friend?'</p>

<p>"'What!' he exclaimed, 'with a woman?'</p>

<p>"'What difference should that make, if she
is greater and more skilful than you?' was
her answer.</p>

<p>"The chief was angered, but he only replied,
'Then take my friend's sledge and
make ready.'</p>

<p>"And so these two, the chief and the
strange, beautiful woman, rushed down the
hillside. For a single moment she lost her
balance, and the chief reached the goal first.</p>

<p>"How the people cheered and shouted!
But the woman silently pointed toward the
top, as much as to say, 'Let us have one
more trial.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"Again the chief climbed the hillside, this
time with the woman by his side. As they
were about to start once more, the stranger
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"'Your sledge is better than mine; if you
wish to be just, you will exchange yours for
mine.'</p>

<p>"'Why should I?' answered the chief. 'I
do not know you. You are not a sister or
wife of mine.' And he turned without further
heed and flung himself down the steep descent,
supposing the woman was also on
the way.</p>

<p>"But not so! She stamped her foot upon
the ground, and suddenly a stream of burning
lava poured forth and rushed down the hillside.
The chief reached the foot of the hill
and turned to see the fiery torrent destroying
everything in its way.</p>

<p>"Too late, he understood everything now.
The strange woman was none other than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
goddess Pele, who had taken this form to sport
with men. He had angered her, and she was
about to destroy him and all his people.</p>

<p>"And look! There rode the goddess, herself,
on the crest of the foremost wave of
lava. What should he do? He instantly
turned aside and fled with his friend to a small
hill from which he could see the awful death
of his people.</p>

<p>"And now the valleys were filled with the
burning torrent. Pele did not intend to let
him escape. Nothing was left but the ocean.
He reached it just as his brother drew near in
his canoe. Together they fled to their old
home across the waters, and never again dared
to visit Hawaii, lest the dreadful goddess
should come forth against him."</p>

<p>When the story is finished, tales are told of
the old days of war and bloodshed; when the
word of the chief was law to his people; when
no life was safe from the power of the priests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and chiefs. Then, indeed, were surely needed
the cities of refuge still standing on this island.</p>

<p>"It is at least a hundred years ago," says
old Hiko, "that my grandfather fled to the
Pahonua, that strong old city whose walls have
sheltered many an innocent man and helpless
woman. He was accused of breaking the
'tabu' the chief of his village had laid upon
a certain spring of water." (Of course, as you
know, "tabu" means <i>sacred</i>, and so the water
of that spring must not be used by any one
except the chief himself.)</p>

<p>"My grandfather was then a young man,
gay and happy. He would never have dared
to break the tabu, but an enemy accused him
of so doing, and the chief sent armed men to
kill him. A good friend heard of it in time
to warn him, and he fled over the mountains
on his trusty horse.</p>

<p>"His pursuers were in full view when he
reached the entrance to the city of refuge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Here they believed he was under the protection
of the gods, so they turned back. Drawing
a long breath of relief, he entered the city.
He lived for some days in one of the houses
built inside its massive walls. Then he came
home again without fear, for he could never
more be harmed for the deed of which he had
been accused.</p>

<p>"In those times, my children," says the old
man, "the thief, even the murderer, was pardoned,
once he reached the city of refuge.
And during wars it was the place to which
women and children fled; there alone were
they safe."</p>

<p>But the people are rested now, and do not
care to think longer of the olden times. As
the tide is far out, a dance upon the beach is
proposed. Upa pounds his drum, and another
of the party plays upon a bamboo flute. All
the others move about on the coral sand in
slow, graceful circles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>While they are enjoying themselves in this
way, we can examine Upa's drum. He made
it from the hollow trunk of a cocoa-palm. It
is covered with shark's skin. Odd as it seems
to us, it serves his purpose very well, and the
boy keeps good time with the dancers. While
he beats upon it he delights in watching
Auwae move about on the sand. She is the
very picture of grace and happiness.</p>



<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>UP THE MOUNTAIN.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> pleasant days pass by for Auwae and
Upa, and the time comes for the great trip to
Kilauea. You must understand that Kilauea
is not the volcano itself, but the largest crater
on the side of Mauna Loa. Many grown
people as well as children picture a volcano
as a great cone with only one deep pit, down
into which they can look when they reach the
summit.</p>

<p>This is not always so; for the fire raging in
the heart of Mauna Loa has burst out in more
than one place on its sides. Kilauea is the
largest of these outlets, or craters. It is a
hard journey to climb even so far as this.
Very few people are daring enough to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
still farther and journey to the summit of
Mauna Loa.</p>

<p>Auwae's mother actually grows excited while
she gets her little daughter ready for the trip.
She does not care to go herself.</p>

<p>"It is too much work. I know I should
get tired; but you can tell me all about it, my
child, when you come back. Then I can see
it through your eyes. And Upa's father will
be kind, and will take good care of you. I
shall not worry."</p>

<p>When the first light of the morning shines
through the tree tops, three clumsy-looking
horses stand in front of Auwae's door. Upa
and his father use two of them; the third one is
for our little brown maiden, who appears with
a fresh garland of flowers upon her head and a
smile on her red lips.</p>

<p>She springs upon the saddle without help,
and sits astride of the horse just as Upa does.
In fact, all Hawaiians ride in this way, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
is very wise. The women could not travel
safely over the rough mountain passes if they
rode like their white cousins.</p>

<p>"Aloha! Aloha! Aloha!" echoes through
the grove, and the party is soon out of sight.
They have more than thirty miles of climbing
before them; the horses must walk nearly all
the way, as it is a steady rise from the village
to the edge of the great crater.</p>

<p>At first, the way is through a perfect forest
of breadfruit, candlenut, and palm trees.
Among them are ferns growing from twenty
to thirty feet high! Their great stalks are
covered with a silky, golden-brown fibre.
Other ferns, more delicate, are wound around
these and live upon their life.</p>

<p>It is cool in the shade of the trees; the way
is narrow and the horses must go in single file
to keep out of the thick underbrush. Presently
the way grows lighter and the party
come out of the forest and pass a large sugar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
plantation. Chinese labourers are cutting down
the long canes and carrying them to the mill
to be crushed. The white overseers are hurrying
from one place to another, urging on the
men and giving directions, while through it all
Auwae can hear the rush and roar of a waterfall.
She cannot see it, because the mill and
boiler-house hide it from her sight.</p>

<p>The party move to one side to let a team of
mules pass them on the narrow road. The
mules are laden with kegs of sugar which must
be carried to the coast and shipped to distant
lands.</p>

<p>The children would like to stop awhile on
the plantation, but Upa's father says they
must not delay. It will be evening before
they can reach the volcano-house.</p>

<p>As they climb higher and higher up the
mountainside, the air grows cooler, yet the
heat from the sun is so great they are
still too warm for comfort. Suddenly a heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
shower takes them by surprise, and Auwae
cries out in delight:</p>

<p>"Upa, isn't this fun? I'm going to open
my mouth and let the raindrops fall right in.
I'm so thirsty! Aren't you?"</p>

<p>The children lie back in their saddles and
leave their trusty horses to follow their leader
onward and ever upward. No one gives a
thought to wet clothing, for will it not be
dry again a few minutes after the rain stops
falling?</p>

<p>See! the lava-beds stretch out before them.
It is clear enough now that Hawaii, the island
of flowers, was born of fire. All these miles
of gray, shining substance once poured, a
broad river of fire, from the crater above.
Some of the lava looks like broad waves;
again, it is in pools, or rivers, or coils, with
great caves here and there. These caves are
really bubbles which have suddenly burst as
they cooled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Auwae looks off to each side of the road,
built with so much labour up the mountain;
then she thinks of what her grandmother has
told her of her own journey to Kilauea, years
ago. At that time there was no road over the
lava-beds, and her horse slipped many times
as he stepped on places smooth as glass. And
many times his hoofs were badly cut on sharp
edges, and left bloody marks behind him.</p>

<p>The air is quite still. Not a sound can be
heard. No birds nor insects make their homes
on these lava stretches. Yet do not think for
a moment that nothing grows here. The
moist air and the rains have been great
workers, and, in some strange way, delicate
ferns, nasturtiums, guavas, and even trees,
have taken root, so that the lava-beds are
nearly covered.</p>

<p>Hour after hour passes by. Auwae gets so
tired she nearly falls from her horse. The
luncheon has been eaten long ago. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
is no water to drink except what the showers
have left in little hollows by the wayside.
The children have stopped their chatter and
lie with closed eyes on their horses' backs.
The smell of sulphur grows strong, and Upa's
father turns around to call out:</p>

<p>"Children, here we are at last! And there
is my old friend Lono in the doorway to
welcome us."</p>



<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE VOLCANO.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Auwae</span> suddenly forgets the long and tiresome
ride, as she jumps from her horse's back
in front of the hotel. This hotel is built on
the edge of a crater! Think of the family
who live here year after year! Night after
night they look from the windows upon the
raging fire below, yet are not afraid. Many
a time the earth shakes beneath them, and the
house rocks to and fro. The shelf of lava on
which it stands may break at any moment,
and the people within may suddenly be flung
over the precipice. Yet they live on, and
work and play as others do who have nothing
to fear.</p>

<p>In many places around the house are cracks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
in the earth from which sulphur fumes are
rising. As the children look out in front
they see the crater itself, more than nine
miles round, and nearly a quarter of a mile
deep.</p>

<p>As they creep out and look over the edge,
what is before them? The crater is filled with
steam, while over in a distant corner of the pit
they look for the first time upon the "house
of everlasting fire," as the old legends call it,&mdash;the
home of the goddess Pele.</p>

<p>The flames rise and fall, now high enough
to light up the evening sky, now low as
though dying out, and with it can be heard
the breathing of this great furnace of nature.
It sounds like the restless ocean many miles
away.</p>

<p>Auwae and Upa hold each other's hands
tightly and do not speak. Surely this is a
wonderful sight. They will not forget it as
long as they live.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>They are so tired, however, that they are
soon fast asleep in "white people's beds," as
they call them. They do not awake till the
sun has driven away the clouds which hang
about the place in the early hours of morning.
Upa's father has already eaten breakfast and
attended to his business with the landlord.</p>

<p>He tells the children that horses are at the
door to carry them down into the crater; for
they have begged him to let them see everything
possible.</p>

<p>What a ride this is down the rough, jagged
side of the pit! The horses pick their way
step by step over the sharp broken lava. But
even here beautiful things are growing. There
are delicate ferns, silvery grasses, pink, white,
and brilliant blue berries. It seems as though
Mother Nature wished to hide the frightful
masses of black and gray lava.</p>

<p>Now the air gets very hot; steam and
sulphur pour through great cracks in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
floor of the crater; the lava itself will burn
if Auwae dares to touch it with her fingers.</p>

<p>The floor of the crater, looking quite even
from above, is broken up into hills and valleys,
immense ridges and rivers of lava which
have poured forth, one above the other, at
different times.</p>

<p>After two hours of hard riding and walking,
Auwae and Upa reach the lake of living fire
and look down, down, into its depths. But
they cannot see the bottom. Each throws in
a garland of flowers as an offering to the goddess
Pele. They know she does not exist,
but it is an old, old custom of the people, and
they have not quite grown out of the idea that
it is safest to do so.</p>

<p>For, look at the flames leaping up at this
very moment! "People <i>may</i> be mistaken,"
thinks Auwae, "and the goddess may get
angry if we are not polite, and suddenly drown
us in fire!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>It is dinner-time before the party get back
to the hotel. They are willing to rest all the
afternoon under the tree-ferns near the house.
They lazily pick the ohele berries growing
about them, as they tell the village news to
the landlord's family.</p>

<p>On the evening of the third day our little
brown maiden finds herself safe at home once
more. She is very well, but quite lame and
sore from her long ride. Her mother says
she shall have a lomi-lomi, and she will feel
all right again.</p>

<p>Auwae stretches herself out on a mat while
an old woman of the village pinches and
pounds and kneads every part of her dear
little body. Do you suppose it hurts? Just
try it yourself the first time you have a chance,
and when it is over see if you do not feel as
limber and care-free as Auwae does.</p>

<p>She dances about under the trees, and
exclaims: "Oh, how nice it is to be alive!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
What a lovely home I have! But I'm glad
I've been to Kilauea, though I would not like
to live there."</p>

<p>At this moment she sees her father coming
down the path to the house. He was away
when she got home, and she runs to welcome
him.</p>

<p>"But, dear papa, what are you hiding
behind you?" she cries.</p>

<p>"I have a present for my little daughter,"
he answers. "It has cost a large sum, but
my only child deserves it, I well know. It is
something for you to treasure all your life."</p>

<p>He hands her a bamboo cylinder, telling
her to see what is inside. The excited girl
opens one end, and out falls a band of tiny
yellow feathers to be worn as a wreath. It is
more precious to this Hawaiian child than a diamond
ring or gold necklace could possibly be.</p>

<p>Why, do you ask? Because of the time
and labour in getting the feathers, which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
found on only one kind of bird in the islands,
or any other place, for that matter. This little
creature is called the oo. It lives among the
mountains. Under each of its wings are a few
bright yellow feathers no more than an inch
long. Hunters spend their lives in snaring
this bird. They place long sticks smeared
with a sticky substance where the oo is apt to
alight. After it is caught, the precious feathers
are plucked and the bird set free.</p>

<p>While Auwae crowns herself with her new
wreath, her father tells her that next month
she shall go away with him on a steamboat.
She shall visit Honolulu, the capital of the
islands. There she shall see the wonderful
war-cloak of Kamehameha the Great. It is
made entirely of oo feathers. Nine kings lived
and died, one after the other, before this priceless
cloak was finished. And now it is guarded
as one of the greatest treasures of the country.</p>

<p>Yes, Auwae shall see, not only this, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
many wonders beside. She shall ride through
the streets with neither man nor animal to
carry her. She shall talk with people miles
away by placing her mouth to a tube. She
shall see how her white cousins live and dress.</p>

<p>But her father does not doubt that she will
be glad to come home again to this little grass
house with the quiet and the peace of the
village life.</p>
